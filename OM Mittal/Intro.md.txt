# Introduction to Java

Welcome to the Introduction to Java guide! This document provides an overview of Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and robust features.

## Overview

Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is designed to be platform-independent, allowing developers to "write once, run anywhere" by compiling code into an intermediate form called bytecode.

## Key Features

- **Platform Independent**: Java code runs on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Object-Oriented**: Utilizes objects and classes for code organization.
- **Simplicity**: Features a simple syntax, especially for those familiar with C/C++.
- **Robustness**: Includes features like garbage collection and exception handling to ensure reliability.
- **Security**: Built with mechanisms to avoid common security issues.
- **Distributed**: Facilitates the creation of distributed applications over networks.
- **Multithreading**: Supports simultaneous execution of multiple tasks.
- **Portability**: Bytecode can run on any platform.
- **High Performance**: Employs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for performance optimization.

## How Java Code Executes

1. **Creating**: Write Java code in a `.java` file.
2. **Compiling**: Use `javac` to compile the `.java` file into `.class` bytecode.
3. **Running**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecode on the target system.

## Essential Terminologies

- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: Executes bytecode and ensures cross-platform consistency.
- **Bytecode**: Intermediate, platform-independent code generated from Java source code.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: A toolkit that includes tools for creating and compiling Java programs.
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Provides the necessary environment to run Java programs.
- **Garbage Collector**: Manages memory by automatically removing unused objects.
- **ClassPath**: Specifies the locations where Java looks for classes and libraries.

## Advantages

- Platform independence
- Object-oriented design
- Strong security features
- Large community support

## Disadvantages

- Can be slower compared to languages like C++
- Automatic memory management may lead to increased memory usage
